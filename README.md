### In Case Of SSL error: certificate verify failed
Rerun script with extra parameter `--insecure` or copy paste this command `./kalinethunter.sh --insecure`

### In case of APT error in kali: the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY
1. Copy the missing key shown. For example:
```bash
Err:1 http://kali.download/kali kali-rolling InRelease
  The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY ED444FF07D8D0BF6
```

The missing key would be `ED444FF07D8D0BF6`

2. Add key to keyserver `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys ED444FF07D8D0BF6`
Just change the final part to the key you found missing
